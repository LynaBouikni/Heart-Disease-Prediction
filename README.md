# 🫀 Heart-Disease-Prediction



##   Overview

This project is an end-to-end machine learning pipeline designed to predict the presence of heart disease in patients based on clinical attributes. It's built as a **proof of concept** for binary classification and explores essential data science workflows, from exploratory data analysis (EDA) to model tuning and evaluation.

The dataset used comes from the **Cleveland Heart Disease dataset**, made accessible via [Kaggle](https://www.kaggle.com/datasets) and originally from the UCI Machine Learning Repository.

## 📌 Objectives

- Understand the heart disease dataset through visual and statistical EDA.
- Build and compare multiple classification models.
- Optimize models using hyperparameter tuning.
- Evaluate models using metrics beyond accuracy (precision, recall, F1, AUC).
- Interpret model decisions through feature importance.
- Apply reproducible and ethical data science practices.
