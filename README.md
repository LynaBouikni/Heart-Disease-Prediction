# ðŸ«€ Heart-Disease-Prediction



##   Overview

This project is an end-to-end machine learning pipeline designed to predict the presence of heart disease in patients based on clinical attributes. It's built for binary classification and implements essential data science workflows, from exploratory data analysis (EDA) to model tuning and evaluation.

The dataset used comes from the **Cleveland Heart Disease dataset**, made accessible via [Kaggle](https://www.kaggle.com/datasets) and originally from the UCI Machine Learning Repository.

## ðŸ“Œ Objectives

- Understand the heart disease dataset through visual and statistical EDA.
- Build and compare multiple classification models.
- Optimize models using hyperparameter tuning.
- Evaluate models using metrics beyond accuracy (precision, recall, F1, AUC).
- Interpret model decisions through feature importance.
- Apply reproducible and ethical data science practices.
